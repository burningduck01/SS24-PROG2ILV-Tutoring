# Session 3

As discused in the last session, I'm providing the exercises earlier, so you can have a look and give them a try before the session. Maybe you can even finish an exercise and you can show us your solution in the upcoming session ;).

## exercise 1: socket UDP

Implement an Server/Client connection using UDP. Try sending a simple message generated by user input, using `input()`, to the server, printing it there and sending a response from the server, aknowledging the message.

## exercise 2: files

Load the provided .json file.
Write for each key in a new .txt file `key: value`.

## exercise 3: databases

### part 1:

Create an SQL Lite database and an user table (id, name, role, dob) and insert ('1', 'root', 'admin', '01-01-2000'). Add 2-3 different user into the db.

### part 2:

In another file: Query all users from the database and print each row of the table.

## exercise 4: iterator

Generate a class with iterator methods called **MyList** that uses a list as an input and uses `__iter__` and `__next__` to iter through the whole list by index, returning  **self.list[i]**.
